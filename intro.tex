\section{Introduction}
Through Spectroscopy, the study of light at particular wavelengths and fluxes, spectral lines are observed and used to determine elemental abundances found in the light's source. From the observations of the data collected from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). HD6268's location is in the Halo Region of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Halo Region positioned outside the plain of the Milky Way Galaxy. It has some of the oldest stars in the Milky Way. This region is vast, which allows the stars to have an extreme distance between them. Since these stars are much older, and have no previous generation of stars before them, their metallicity is lower than the typical star found in the Milky Way.
