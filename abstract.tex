\section{Abstract}
The objective of this article is to properly format spectral data of a star for the program MOOG \cite{moog}. MOOG is a program commonly used in Astrophysics and Astronomy to determine elemental compositions of stars. In this article we will show how python is an ideal way of retrieving data from a fits file, and smoothing/normalizing the data for MOOG. As well, properly format the data to a text file, so MOOG is able to read it.The objective of this article is to properly format spectral data of a star for the program MOOG \cite{moog}.
